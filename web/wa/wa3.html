    <h2 id="1st">Introduction</h2>

    <a href="../img/levelsofroastedbeans.jpg"><img src="../img/levelsofroastedbeans.jpg" alt="photo of coffee beans at different levels of roast"></a>
    
    <p>coffee was first introduced in the 15th century,and has a long history within the middle east.</p> 
    <p>it originated in yemen where they first roasted the beans and brewed coffee similarly to the way we all do now.</p>
    <p>its main use was by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism">Sufi</a> circles to stay awake for their religious rituals</p>

    <h2 id="2nd">Types of Coffee</h2>

    <p>Generally there are two main coffee types</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica">Arabica</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_canephora#Cultivation_and_use">Robusta</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>more often arabica is used for its sweeter and smoother flavour,whereas robusta is stronger and more bitter.</p>
    <p>robusta is mainly found in vietnam (they are the largest producers of robusta coffee) as well as parts of india and indonesia.</p>
    <p>arabica coffee is found almost everywhere and is the main source of coffee for many popular coffee chains.</p>
    
    <h2 id="3rd">Best Coffee Spots, Boulder</h2>

    <p>in my opinion these are a few of the best places in boulder to get a good cup of coffee whether you like it black, sweet, hot, or iced.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://january.coffee/">January Coffee</a></p>
            <a href="../img/januarycoffee.jpg"><img src="../img/januarycoffee.jpg" alt="photo of january coffee's entry way" width="300" height="300"></a>
            <p>they have a variety of choices as well as seasonal drinks, my personal favorite is their dirty horchata latte, areas to sit and study. only downside is theres no wifi.</p>
            
        </li>
        <li><p><a href="https://www.alpinemodern.com/">Alpine Modern Cafe</a></p>
            <a href="../img/alpinemodern.jpg"><img src="../img/alpinemodern.jpg" alt="photo of alpine modern Cafe interior"></a>
            <p>a perfect place to sit and study or have breakfast/brunch. also good to grab a cup while shopping on 29th st mall.</p>

        </li>
        <li><p><a href="https://flatironcoffee.com/">Flatirons Coffee</a></p>
            <a href="../img/flatironscoffee.jpg"><img src="../img/flatironscoffee.jpg" alt="photo of flatirnos coffee entryway" width="300" height="300"></a>
            <p>good place to sit and study, my favorite part is the names of their drinks are unconventional to say the least. and the decor and overall vibe of the place is very relaxed.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
